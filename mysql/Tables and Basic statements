Creating tables

CREATE TABLE table_name(
    col1_name data_type,
    ...
    );

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXIST quotes( //

);

Example:
CREATE TABLE guests(
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age TINYINT
    );

use data-base; //putting the table in this data-base

#//Creating a table in database
USE zenith_test_db;

DROP TABLE contacts;

CREATE TABLE contacts(
  id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  or  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  name VARCHAR(100),
  phone_number VARCHAR(40),
  created_at DATE,
  age TINYINT,
 );

#//SELECTS from database, if we have a table called books

SELECT * from books #selects everything

SELECT author FROM books        #//selects author for that ID
WHERE id = 2;

UPDATE books         #//updates of changes values for that ID
SET author = "Hello"
WHERE id = 3;

DELETE FROM books       #// deletes the whole row
WHERE id = 4;

DELETE FROM books;      #//deletes the whole table

//Deeper in WHERE clause

Where first_name LIKE '%z'; #//where last name ends with z
Where first_name LIKE 'z%'; #// where last name starts with z
Where first_name LIKE '%z%'; #// where last name contains with z

SELECT DISTINCT first_name From employees
Where first_name LIKE "%z%";
