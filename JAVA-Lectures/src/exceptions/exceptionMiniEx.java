public class exceptionMiniEx {
//Mini-exercise: Investigate the substring method for String objects in the Java API. Find out what kind of exception it throws. Create a test class with a main method. Set up a try-catch block that defines a string and finds its length. Once you have the length of your string, modify your program so it creates a substring from your original string, but give it an index that doesn't exist so you get the error message.
//
//    Optional: play with the .getMessage and .printStackTrace methods.
//
//    Optional: what are some other ways you can get the same exception? Try to set up your program so as to produce and catch these exceptions.
    String str = "Hello, World!";
