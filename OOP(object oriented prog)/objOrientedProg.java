// ================================= OOP PRE-LECTURE RESEARCH QUESTIONS
// What is the difference between static and instance methods/variables?
//A. Scope of access. static belong to a class and intance belongs to instance of a class.

// What is an instance and what is instantiation?
// instance when a class is created in memory at run time, the otherone is when you make a class by the (new) word
// What is an object in Java?
// A set of keys with values.
// What is a class in Java?
//A. 
// What is the difference between a class and an object?
// What is a constructor?
// What are some uses of the ‘final’ keyword?
// What are some uses of the ‘this’ keyword?
// What are visibility modifiers?
// Why use private visibility?


// ================================= OOP INTRO

// -- UP TO NOW --

//  - using functions/methods to group together steps for a program to work


// -- DEFINITION --

//   OOP - Object-oriented programming

//   - A programming paradigm where state (data/properties) and behavior (functionality/methods)
//     are grouped together (often into objects)
//   - Objects in Java are created from classes (a blueprint for an object/instance)


// -- ADVANTAGES OF OOP --

//   Programming in an Object-oriented way can be used to develop code with a clearer and more modular organization in the following ways:

//   - implementation details can be abstracted away making code more readable (Abstraction) ====> (Mafhoom ya bardasht)
//   - restriction of access to various levels of abstraction preventing data inconsistencies (Encapsulation)
//   - duplication is minimized through inheritance hierarchies (Inheritance)
//   - flexible code where multiple implementations may be swapped out behind a common interface (Polymorphism) ====> (chand rekhti)


// -- THE FOUR PILLARS OF OOP --

//   1. Abstraction - keep it clean
//   2. Encapsulation - keep it contained
//   3. Inheritance - keep it DRY
//   4. Polymorphism - keep it versatile

//   Today we will focus on Abstraction and Encapsulation.


// -- CONCEPTS COVERED --

//   - how to create custom classes and objects from these classes
//   - defining and using instance and static fields
//   - how to control class constructors
//   - using the "this" keyword
//   - controlling encapsulation with visibility modifiers
